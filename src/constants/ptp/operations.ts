This parameter allows the initiator to ask for only the handles that represent data objects that possess a format specified by the ObjectFormatCode. If a list of handles that represent only image objects is desired, this second parameter may be set to 0xFFFFFFFF. If it is not used, it shall be set to 0x00000000. If the value is non-zero, and the responder does not support specification by ObjectFormatCode, it should fail the operation by returning a ResponseCode with the value of Specification_By_Format_Unsupported. If a single store is specified, and the store is unavailable because of media removal, this operation should return Store_Not_Available. The third parameter is optional, and may be used to request only a list of the handles of objects that belong to a particular association. If the third parameter is a valid ObjectHandle for an Association, this operation should return only a list of ObjectHandles of objects that are direct children of the Association, and therefore only ObjectHandles that refer to objects that possess an ObjectInfo data set with the ParentObject field set to the value indicated in the third parameter. If a list of only those ObjectHandles corresponding to objects in the “root” of a store is desired, this parameter may be set to 0xFFFFFFFF. If the ObjectHandle referred to is not a valid ObjectHandle, the appropriate response is Invalid_ObjectHandle. If this parameter is specified and is a valid ObjectHandle, but the object referred to is not an association, the response Invalid_ParentObject should be returned.
