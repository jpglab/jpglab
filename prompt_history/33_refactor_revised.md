We are building an API around Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP).

We have amassed a vast collection on this protocol (both the generic ISO spec and various vendor implementations). You have access to all of this in the `docs/` folder.

Essential background context:

- You **MUST FULLY** read, understand, and adhere to this prompt before continuing.
- You **MUST FULLY** read, understand, and adhere to the important notes before continuing.
- You **MUST FULLY** read, understand, and adhere to the goals before continuing.
- You **MUST FULLY** read, understand, and adhere to the success criteria before continuing.
- You **MUST FULLY** read, understand, and adhere to `./AGENTS.md` before continuing.
- You _may_ read through `prompt_history/` to understand our work so far at any time.
- You _may_ read through anything in the `docs/` folder to understand the ISO or vendor implementations of the spec.

Evaluate the attached refactor proposal against the below goals and highlight any areas we have not achieved a goal.

Goals:

- **Refactor PTP constants into spec-mirrored files** (Operation, Response, Event, Device Property)
- **Implement universal HexCode type** for hex-encoded values across all relevant areas
- **Structure vendor-specific constants**
    - Place in vendor-specific folders
    - Mirror PTP constants folder structure
- **Add Control specification**
    - Represent button presses and hardware input emulation
    - Define vendor-specific implementation (not in PTP spec)
- **Enhance Property Mapper interface**
    - Extend and generalize for all types
    - Update vendor specifications accordingly
- **Simplify Generic PTP Camera**
    - Mirror PTP spec implementation directly
    - Remove unnecessary overrides
- **Add comprehensive descriptions**
    - Include for PTP implementation and vendor overrides
    - Encode parameters for set/get operations with parameters
- **Remove backwards compatibility requirements**
    - Replace all references with new structure
- **Centralize datatype definitions**
    - Create single file in PTP constants folder
    - Remove from src/core/interfaces/message-builder.interface.ts
- **Eliminate duplicate naming**
    - Use single IN_ALL_UPPER_SNAKE_CASE naming convention
    - Define as object lists with name field
    - Generate runtime mappings as needed
- **Streamline vendor constant mappings**
    - Same names indicate ISO spec overrides
    - Different names indicate ISO spec extensions
    - Remove explicit generic-to-vendor mappings
- **Implement encoder/decoder for device properties**
    - Support on both ISO and vendor sides
    - Decode: raw hex → pretty string (0x00000064 → "ISO 100")
    - Encode: pretty string → raw hex
- **Ensure TypeScript compatibility**
    - Full IntelliSense support
    - Runtime error handling for incorrect parameters
    - Complete referenceability
